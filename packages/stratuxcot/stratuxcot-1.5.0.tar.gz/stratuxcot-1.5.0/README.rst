The Stratux Cursor on Target Gateway transforms Stratux aircraft
position information into Cursor on Target (CoT) Position Location Information
(PLI) for display on Situational Awareness (SA) applications such as the
Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), WinTAK, RaptorX, et al.

Stratux messages are received via the /traffic Websocket.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG_FILE, --CONFIG_FILE CONFIG_FILE
      -d, --DEBUG           Enable DEBUG logging
      -U COT_URL, --COT_URL COT_URL
                            URL to CoT Destination. Must be a URL, e.g. tcp:1.2.3.4:1234 or tls:...:1234, etc.
      -W STRATUX_WS, --STRATUX_WS STRATUX_WS
                            Stratux Websocket URL.

Examples
========
Connect to the Stratux device at ws://172.17.2.188/traffic, and forward CoT to
TCP Port 8087 on Host 172.17.2.152::

    $ stratuxcot -U tcp:172.17.2.152:8087 -W ws://172.17.2.188/traffic


Running as a Service
====================

It's recommended to run `stratuxcot` as a service ("daemon") using a built-in service manager like systemd.

To accomplish this, first create the file `/etc/systemd/system/stratuxcot.service`::

     [Unit]
     Description=StratuxCoT Service
     After=multi-user.target
     [Service]
     ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/stratuxcot -U tcp:x.x.x.x:8088 -W ws://127.0.0.1/traffic
     Restart=always
     RestartSec=5
     Environment=DEBUG=1
     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target

Then, it's as easy as::

    $ sudo systemctl enable stratuxcot.service
    $ sudo systemctl start stratuxcot.service

To see status & logs::

    $ sudo systemctl status stratuxcot.service
    $ sudo journalctl -xe

Alternatively, you can use supervisord::

    $ sudo yum install supervisor
    $ sudo service supervisord start

Create /etc/supervisor.d/stratuxcot.ini with the following content::

    [program:stratuxcot]
    command=stratuxcot -U tcp:172.17.2.152:8087 -W ws://172.17.2.188/traffic

And update supervisor::

    $ sudo supervisorctl update
