Changes in Flask-Restless-NG
============================

Version 2.0.0b
--------------
This is a Beta version with some backward incompatible changes, and more incompatible changes are expected before the
final release

Refactored fetching resource collections:
- SQL query optimizations for 'include' and 'relationship' objects, using `selectinload`
  (3x-5x performance improvement when tested on large datasets)

Deprecations:
- 'single' parameter is no longer supported - makes code complicated, is not defined in JSON API specs and can be easily
  replicated on a client side
- 'group' parameter is not longer supported - not defined in JSON API specifications, confusing and broken for PostrgeSQL
- JSONP callbacks are no longer supported - please reach out if you have a use case for them

Version 1.0.6
-------------
- Prevent redundant SQL queries during pagination and resource inclusion
