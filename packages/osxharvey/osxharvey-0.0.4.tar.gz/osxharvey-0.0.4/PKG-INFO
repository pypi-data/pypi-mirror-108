# OsxHarvey

The *Big White Rabbit* OsxHarvey is a small tool/Wifi-Sniffer to grab all the data.

Being a rabbit, Harvey hops from wifi-channel to wifi-channel to make sure he doesn't 
miss anything.

Harvey is intended to be used by security professionals for LEGAL purposes.

## This package is in pre-Alpha and therefore still under construction

# Usage:

```python
from osxharvey import OsxHarvey

# Following params are default values

bwr = OsxHarvey(
        iface="en0", rounds=1,
        ch_from=1, ch_to=15,
        devices=False, ssids=False,
        probes=False, vendors=False,
        verbose=False
    )

# Params:

"""
:param str iface: Interface to sniff on
:param int rounds: How many times to go through the Wifi channels
:param int ch_from: Wifi channel to start sniffing on
:param int ch_to: Wifi channel to end sniffing on
:param bool devices: Write collected device/manufacturer combinations to file
:param bool ssids: Write detected ssids to file
:param bool probes: Write collected probe requests to file
:param bool vendors: Write list of unique detected vendors to file
:param bool verbose: Toggles verbose output
"""

# Disconnets the Wifi, enables monitor mode and starts scanning
# returns a dictionary with the collected data
results = bwr.start_scanning()

```
