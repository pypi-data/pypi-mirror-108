    Sharding improvements:

    * Prevent object updates from auto-creating shard containers. This
      ensures more consistent listings for sharded containers during
      rebalances.

    * Deleted shard containers are no longer considered root containers.
      This prevents unnecessary sharding audit failures and allows the
      deleted shard database to actually be unlinked.

    * The sharder daemon has been enhanced to better support the shrinking
      of shards that are no longer required. Shard containers will now
      discover from their root container if they should be shrinking. They
      will also discover the shards into which they should shrink, which may
      include the root container itself.

    * Improved performance of sharded container listings when performing
      prefix listings.

    * Improved container-sharder stat reporting to reduce load on root
      container databases.

    * The container sharder can now handle containers with special
      characters in their names.

    * ``swift-container-info`` now summarizes shard range information.
      Pass ``-v``/``--verbose`` if you want to see all of them.

    * Don't inject shard ranges when user quits.

    * Various other minor bug fixes and improvements.
