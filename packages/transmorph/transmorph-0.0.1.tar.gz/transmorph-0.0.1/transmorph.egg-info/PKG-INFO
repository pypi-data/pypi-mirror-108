#+TITLE: Transmorph (anciently WOTi)

This python package aims to provide an easy interface for integrating
datasets using optimal transport (OT)- and Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)-based
methods. We plan to extend the package beyond data integration, with
additional OT-related unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.
*Warning:* This package is still in an early stage. Feel free to
open an issue in case of unexpected behvior.

* Installation

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/Risitop/WOTi
pip install ./woti
#+end_src

* Examples

See three example notebooks in =examples/= directory.

* Usage

This package offers four main integration techniques, two based on
OT and two based on GW. Both OT and GW comes in two variants, balanced
(similar to [[https://github.com/rsinghlab/SCOT][SCOT]] technique) and unbalanced, using a quadratic program
in order to estimate data points weights. These weights are chosen
so that the weighted Gaussian mixture distribution is close to be
uniform over the dataset.

Assuming two numpy arrays *X* and *Y* representing source and target
datasets, WOTi can be used in the following way. First, create a
Woti object. The scale parameter adjusts kernel bandwidth, and needs
some tuning according to cloud sparsity.

#+begin_src python
import woti

X, Y = ... # datasets, np.ndarray
integration = woti.Woti(method='ot')
#+end_src

Then, simply apply the integration method to project *X* onto *Y*.

#+begin_src python
X_integrated = integration.fit_transform(X, Y)
#+end_src
