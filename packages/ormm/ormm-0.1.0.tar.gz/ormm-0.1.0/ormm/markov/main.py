    """
    Perform Markov Analysis of continuous time discrete state markov chain
    (CTMC) process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    states : array-like
        Vector-like of length M containing the values associated with the
        states, which must be homogeneous in type. If None, the values
        default to integers 0 through M-1.
    rate_matrix : array-like
        matrix of size MxM detailing the stationary probabilities of moving
        from one state to another.
    t : int
        Integer for the end time period for the transient probability analysis.
        If this is given, then either d or n must be given, and init must be
        given as well.
    d : float
        Float for the small delta (amount of time per step) for numerically
        solving the transient probabilities.  Either this or n (number of
        steps) must be given (one can be inferred from the other and 't').
    n : int
        Integer of the number of steps to take for numerically solving the
        transient probabilities.  Either this or 'd' must be given.
        If both are given and they do not coincide with t (d*n = t), an error
        will be raised.
    init : array-like
        Vector-like of length n containing the initial state values for
        the transient probability analyis.  This must be given if 't', 'd', or
        'n' is given.

    Returns
    -------
    analysis : dict
        Dictionary with results of markov analysis

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError

        arguments are given, or if t, d, and n are given, but their values are

    """
    Perform Markov Analysis of discrete time discrete state markov chain
    (DTMC) process.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : array-like
        The transition matrix.  Must be of shape n x n.
    states : array-like
        Array_like of length n containing the values associated with the
        states, which must be homogeneous in type. If None, the values
        default to integers 0 through n-1.
    sim_kwargs : dict
        Dictionary of key word arguments to be passed to the simulation
        of the markov process.  If None, then no simulation will be performed.
        These include ts_length (length of each
        simulation) and init (Initial state values).
    trans_kwargs : dict
        Dictionary of options for the transient probability analysis (tsa).
        If None is passed instead of dict, no tsa will be done.
        ts_length is the number of time periods to analyze, while init is
        the initial state probability vector.
    cost_kwargs : dict
        Dictionary of cost parameters for cost analysis.  If None, then
        no cost analysis will be performed.  These include state (vector of
        costs of being in each state), transition (matrix of costs of
        transitioning from one state to another), and num (number of
        these processes - total cost multiplied by this, default 1).

    Returns
    -------
    analysis : dict
        Dictionary with results of markov analysis

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If sim_kwargs, trans_kwargs, or cost_kwargs is given, but their
        required arguments are not passed.  These are described in the
        Notes section.

    Notes
    -----
    The required arguments if the kwargs are passed are:

    * sim_kwargs: `ts_length` is required, the length of the sim.

    * trans_kwargs: `ts_length` is required, the number of periods
      to analyze

    * cost_kwargs: `state` and `transition` are required, which are the
      costs of being in any state and the costs of transitioning from one
      state to another.
