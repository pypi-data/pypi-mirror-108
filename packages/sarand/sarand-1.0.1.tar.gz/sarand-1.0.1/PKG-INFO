# Documentation for AMR Context Extraction
This document provides an overview of how the proposed tool can be installed and used. It attempts to document all necessary details to set up the tool, and provides some run guides.

## Overview
This tool can be used to extract the neighborhood of the target Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) genes from the assembly graph.
It can also be used to simulate sequence reads from some reference genomes (through ART), run MetaSPAdes to assemble the simulated reads and then reconstruct the neighborhood of the AMR genes.

## Installation
### Step I: install the dependencies
Our tool relies on several dependencies, including Python, Prokka, RGI, BLAST, Bandage, MetaSPAdes (in case the assembly graph has not already been generated) and ART (in case of simulating reads).
The most straight forward way to install this tool's dependencies is using bioconda.
#### Cloning the tool repository
`git clone https://github.com/beiko-lab/AMR_context`

Now, move to AMR_context directory.
#### Installing bioconda
Make sure [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html) has been installed and the channels are set properly as follows.
```
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```
#### Creating a new conda environment
It's recommend to set up a conda environment first, so packages and
versions don't get mixed up with system versions.
`conda create -n amr_context python=3.6.10`

#### Activating the conda environment
`conda activate amr_context`

#### Installing BLAST
The installation instructions are available for [Linux/Unix/MacOS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52640/) and [Windows](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52637/). For more details, please refer to [Blast+ user manual](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279690/).

#### Installing dependencies through conda
```
conda install pip
conda install rgi=5.1.1
conda install prokka
conda install art
conda install bandage
```
Links to their repositories can be found here:
- prokka: https://github.com/tseemann/prokka
- RGI: https://github.com/arpcard/rgi
- Bandage: https://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/
- ART: https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/

Note: In case, prokka can't be installed through bioconda, I suggest using the docker
container [staphb/prokka](https://hub.docker.com/r/staphb/prokka) by the following command:
`docker pull staphb/prokka:latest`. Please note that PROKKA_COMMAND_PREFIX variable in params.py need to be updated with an appropriate value which is probably an empty string unless prokka is run through docker.  

#### Installing python requirements
Note: Make sure that you are in the root directory of this tool (AMR_context).
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Step II: Testing
#### Updating params.py
Make sure to update the following parameter in code/params.py.
- PROKKA_COMMAND_PREFIX (it probably should either be an empty string or the command from docker if you installed prokka via docker)

Note: you might also need to update the following parameters in code/params.py to provide the path to Bandage, ART and SPAdes, in case they have not been installed via conda.
- BANDAGE_PATH (the path to access bandage executable file)
- ART_PATH (the path to access art_illumina directory)
- SPADES_PATH (the path to spades.py)


#### Running the test code
To run the code, make sure you are in the created conda environment.
To activate it, run:

`conda activate amr_context`

and then run the code by:

`python code/full_pipeline.py`

Note: You don't need to install and set the parameters for ART and SPAdes if the assembly graph is provided as an input.

#### Expected results
All results will be available in test directory.
Here is the list of important directories and files that can be seen there and a short description of their content.
- metagenome.fasta: a file containing all ref genomes.
- metagenome_1.fq and metagenome_2.fq: reads simulated by ART from metagenome.fasta
- AMR_info: if reference genomes are available, this directory contains the list of identified AMR sequences, their extracted neighborhood and annotation.
  - AMR_info/sequences/:The sequence of identified AMRs is stored here, with a name similar to their original name (file name is generated by calling `code/utils.py::restricted_amr_name_from_modified_name(amr_name_from_title(amr_original_name)))`
  - AMR_info/ref_annotations/: the annoation details are stored here.
  - AMR_info/AMR_ref_neighborhood.fasta: all extracted neighborhood sequences are stored in this file.

  - sequences_info/sequences_info_{params.seq_length}/sequences/: the extracted sequences in the neighborhood of each AMR are stored in a file like `ng_sequences_{AMR_NAME}_{params.seq_length}_{DATE}.txt`.
  For each extracted sequence, the first line denotes the corresponding path, where the nodes representing the AMR sequence are placed in '[]'.
  The next line denotes the extracted sequence where the AMR sequence is in lower case letters and the neighborhood is in upper case letters.
  - sequences_info/sequences_info_{params.seq_length}/paths_info/: The information of nodes representing the AMR neighborhood including their name, the part of the sequence represented by each node (start position and end position) as well as their coverage is stored in a file like `ng_sequences_{AMR_NAME}_{params.seq_length}_{DATE}.csv`
- annotations/annotations_{params.seq_length}: The annotation details are stored in this directory.
  - annotations/annotations_{params.seq_length}/annotation_{AMR_NAME}_{params.seq_length}: this directory contains all annotation details.
    - prokka_dir_extracted{NUM}_{DATE}: it contains the output of prokka for annotation of a sequence extracted from the neighborhood of the target AMR gene in the assembly graph.

    - vis_annotation.csv: this csv file contains the annotations of extracted sequences from both ref genomes and the graph and is used for visualization
    - gene_comparison_<AMR_NAME>.png: An image visualizing annotations
  - annotations/annotations_{params.seq_length}/not_found_annotation_amrs_in_graph.txt: the list of all AMRs available in the reference genomes but not identified in the graph.
- evaluation/evaluation_{params.seq_length}/summaryMetrics_up_down_{GENE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD}_{DATE}.csv: This csv file contains the calculated precision and sensitivity for all AMRs comparing the sequences extracted from the graph with those of the ref genomes.

### Python files
#### 1- full_pipeline.py
This is the core file to do all the steps available in our tool including concatenating ref genomes in a single file, simulating reads, assembling reads, extracting amr neighborhood, annotating amr neighborhood sequences and evaluation (in case that ref genomes are available).

To run, make sure that parameters are set in code/params.py:

`python code/full_pipeline.py`

#### 2- extract_neighborhood.py
This is the main file to extract the neighborhood of an AMR gene from an assembly graph.

To run:

```
python code/extract_neighborhood.py --amr/-A <AMR gene file path in FASTA format>
--gfa/-G <GFA assembly graph>
--length/-L <length of the linear sequence around AMR gene to be extracted (default = 1000)>
--main_dir <the output directory to store the results>
```
#### 3- find_amrs_in_sample.py
This code is used to find all AMRs available in a metagenome sample, extract their neighborhood sequences and annotate them.

To run:
```
python code/find_amrs_in_sample.py --db <metagenome file path>
    --seq <fasta file containing all AMR sequences>
```
Note: it reads 3 parameetrs from params.py:
- params.PROKKA_COMMAND_PREFIX
- params.use_RGI
- params.RGI_include_loose

#### 4- amr_neighborhood_in_contigs.py
This code is used to find the neighborhood of AMRs in a contig file, annotate them, compare them with that of the ref genomes and calculate the sentivity and precision.

To run:

`code/python amr_neighborhood_in_contigs.py`
NOTE: It reads required parameters from code/params.py and the most important parameters need to be set correctly there, are:
- params.seq_length
- params.contig_file
- params.amr_identity_threshold
- params.amr_files
- params.ref_ng_annotations_file
- params.main_dir

NOTE: The result are available in the following directory:
`params.main_dir+'contigs_output_'+<params.seq_length>`

#### 5- annotation_visualization.py
This file is used to visualize sequences annotations.

To run:
```
python annotation_visualization.py --csvfile <annotation file path>
    --title <the image title> --output <the output image name>
```
