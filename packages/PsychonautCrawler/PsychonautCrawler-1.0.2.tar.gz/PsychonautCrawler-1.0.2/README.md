# PsychonautCrawler
## What is this? Why?
This project is a crawler, or scraper if you prefer, for the website [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/). I plan to be very extensive with it since this is my first big project with Python, as I learn it in college. A web crawler is a bot that goes on websites and indexes them; search engines use them for this reason. However, they can be controversial because they can go and index websites meant to be private, thus leading to websites including ``robots.txt`` that request them not to index some, or all, of the website.

Like I stated above this is a learning project for myself, thus it will be going to be going through a lot of changes and there probably are going to be mistakes.

## Currently these are my plans *(are subject to change):*
- [x] Fix the filing project structure
- [ ] Understand how to recognize if there is a ``robots.txt`` warding me away
- [x] Fix the name from Psychonaught -> Psychonaut
- [ ]  Enable searching for specific substances
- [ ] Print to documents
	- [ ] JSON
	- [ ] CSV
	- [ ] Markdown
- [ ] Ability to see other aspects
	- [ ] Experience reports
	- [ ] Subjective effects
	- [ ] Research
	- [ ] Dangerous interactions
	- [ ] Legality
- [ ] Documentation
	- [ ] In ``/docs/`` would be nice
	- [ ] Use the projects on GitHub more
	- [x] Fix the PyPi resource

## Project Structure
This project also is [available on pypi](https://pypi.org/project/psychonaughtcrawler/), I use upload it there so that I can import the project globally and also people can install it using ``pip``.
