## Description

The HTTP client and HTTP server connections enable an AEA to communicate with external servers, respectively clients, via HTTP. 

The HTTP client connection receives request envelops from an agent's skill, translates each into an HTTP request and sends it to a server external to the agent. If it receives an HTTP response from the server within a timeout window, it translates it into a response envelope, and sends this back to the relevant skill inside the agent.

The HTTP server connection allows you to run a server inside the connection itself which accepts requests from clients external to the agent. The HTTP server connection validates requests it receives against a provided OpenAPI file. It translates each valid request into an envelope and sends it to the skill specified in the connections configuration. If it receives a valid response envelope from the skill within a timeout window, the connection translates the response envelope into an HTTP response and serves it to the client.

## HTTP Client

The `fetchai/simple_data_request:0.12.0` skill demonstrates a simple use case of the HTTP Client connection.

The `HttpRequestBehaviour` in `behaviours.py` periodically sends HTTP envelops to the HTTP client connection. Its `act()` method, periodically called, simply calls `_generate_http_request` which contains the logic for enqueueing an HTTP request envelop.

The `HttpHandler` in `handler.py` is a basic handler for dealing with HTTP response envelops received from the HTTP client connection. In the `handle()` method, the responses are dealt with by the private `_handle_response` method which essentially logs the response and adds the body of the response into the skill's shared state. 

## HTTP Server

Create a new AEA:

``` bash
aea create my_aea
cd my_aea
```

Add the http server connection package:

``` bash
aea add connection fetchai/http_server:0.21.0
```

Update the default connection:

``` bash
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/http_server:0.21.0
```

Modify the `api_spec_path`:

``` bash
aea config set vendor.fetchai.connections.http_server.config.api_spec_path "../examples/http_ex/petstore.yaml"
```

Ensure the file exists under the specified path!

Create and add a private key:

``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai
aea add-key fetchai
```

Install the dependencies:

``` bash
aea install
```

Write and add your skill:

``` bash
aea scaffold skill http_echo
```

You can implement a simple http echo skill (modelled after the standard echo skill) which prints out the content of received messages and responds with success.


First, delete the `my_model.py` and `behaviour.py` files (in `my_aea/skills/http_echo/`). The server will be purely reactive, so you only need the `handlers.py` file. Update `skill.yaml` accordingly, so set `models: {}` and `behaviours: {}`.

Next implement a basic handler which prints the received envelopes and responds:

``` python
import json
from typing import cast

from aea.protocols.base import Message
from aea.skills.base import Handler

from packages.fetchai.protocols.http.message import HttpMessage


class HttpHandler(Handler):
    """This implements the echo handler."""

    SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL = HttpMessage.protocol_id

    def setup(self) -> None:
        """
        Implement the setup.

        :return: None
        """

    def handle(self, message: Message) -> None:
        """
        Implement the reaction to an envelope.

        :param message: the message
        :return: None
        """
        http_msg = cast(HttpMessage, message)
        if http_msg.performative == HttpMessage.Performative.REQUEST:
            self.context.logger.info(
                "received http request with method={}, url={} and body={}".format(
                    http_msg.method,
                    http_msg.url,
                    http_msg.bodyy,
                )
            )
            if http_msg.method == "get":
                self._handle_get(http_msg)
            elif http_msg.method == "post":
                self._handle_post(http_msg)
        else:
            self.context.logger.info(
                "received response ({}) unexpectedly!".format(http_msg)
            )

    def _handle_get(self, http_msg: HttpMessage) -> None:
        """
        Handle a Http request of verb GET.

        :param http_msg: the http message
        :return: None
        """
        http_response = HttpMessage(
            dialogue_reference=http_msg.dialogue_reference,
            target=http_msg.message_id,
            message_id=http_msg.message_id + 1,
            performative=HttpMessage.Performative.RESPONSE,
            version=http_msg.version,
            status_code=200,
            status_text="Success",
            headers=http_msg.headers,
            bodyy=json.dumps({"tom": {"type": "cat", "age": 10}}).encode("utf-8"),
        )
        self.context.logger.info(
            "responding with: {}".format(http_response)
        )
        http_response.counterparty = http_msg.counterparty
        self.context.outbox.put_message(message=http_response)

    def _handle_post(self, http_msg: HttpMessage) -> None:
        """
        Handle a Http request of verb POST.

        :param http_msg: the http message
        :return: None
        """
        http_response = HttpMessage(
            dialogue_reference=http_msg.dialogue_reference,
            target=http_msg.message_id,
            message_id=http_msg.message_id + 1,
            performative=HttpMessage.Performative.RESPONSE,
            version=http_msg.version,
            status_code=200,
            status_text="Success",
            headers=http_msg.headers,
            bodyy=b"",
        )
        self.context.logger.info(
            "responding with: {}".format(http_response)
        )
        http_response.counterparty = http_msg.counterparty
        self.context.outbox.put_message(message=http_response)

    def teardown(self) -> None:
        """
        Implement the handler teardown.

        :return: None
        """
```

And update the `skill.yaml` accordingly:

``` yaml
handlers:
  http_handler:
    args: {}
    class_name: HttpHandler
```

Finally, run the fingerprinter (note, you will have to replace the author name with your author handle):
``` bash
aea fingerprint skill fetchai/http_echo:0.19.0
```

You can now run the AEA:
``` bash
aea run
```

In a separate terminal, you can create a client and communicate with the server:
``` python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000')
response.status_code
# >>> 404
# we receive a not found since the path is not available in the api spec

response = requests.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/pets')
response.status_code
# >>> 200
response.content
# >>> b'{"tom": {"type": "cat", "age": 10}}'

response = requests.post('http://127.0.0.1:8000/pets')
response.status_code
# >>> 200
response.content
# >>> b''
```
