        2. There should be just one plugin in each subdirectory.
        3. In each subdirectory the following files are required (case-sensitive):
            - plugin.lua: Contains the plugin code.
            - README.md: Contains a description of the plugin.
            - thumbnail.txt: Contains a sentence/paragraph with a short description of the plugin.
            - release_notes.txt: Contains release notes of the plugin.
