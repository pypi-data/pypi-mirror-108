        When cloning the repo directory the source code for the website has to be built. You will require `node` and `npm` and then run:
        
        `python setup.py build_dashboard`
        
        **Note:** This is not necessary if you install via `pip` it ships with everything built for you out of the box. No external dependencies required to run the dashboard.
