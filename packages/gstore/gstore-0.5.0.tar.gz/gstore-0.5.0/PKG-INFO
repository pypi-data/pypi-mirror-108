------------------

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Introduced ability to specify the maximum number of concurrent processes to
  use when syncing.


Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Reformat log entries to provide logs in a bit more readable format as well
  as process id (PID).
* Changed additional groups of dependencies declared in ``setup.py`` so that
  ``develop`` is superset now for ``testing`` and ``docs``.
* Remove dependencies from ``develop`` group which are not necessary for developing
  the package.
* Used single ``requirements.txt`` file to declare project dependencies.
  Additional dependencies from ``develop``, ``testing`` and ``docs`` groups
  lives now in ``setup.py`` or ``tox.ini``.


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Added missed files to the package contents.

* Fixed package description.


Trivial/Internal Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Replaced ``pytest-cov`` by ``coverage[toml]`` for code coverage measurement.
