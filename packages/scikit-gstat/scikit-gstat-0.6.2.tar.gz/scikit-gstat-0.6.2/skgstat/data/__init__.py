# define the functions
def pancake(N=500, band=0, seed=42):
    """
    Sample of the :func:`pancake_field <skgstat.data.pancake_field>`.
    By default, the Red band is sampled at 500 random
    location without replacement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        Number of sample points to use.
    band : int
        can be 0 (Red), 1 (Green), 2 (Blue) or ``'mean'``, which
        will average all three RGB bands
    seed : int
        By default a seed is set to always return the same
        sample for same N and band input

    Returns
    -------
    result : dict
        Dictionary of the sample and a citation information.
        The sample is a tuple of two numpy arrays.

    Notes
    -----
    The image originates from a photograph of an actual pancake.
    The image was cropped to an 500x500 pixel extent keeping the
    center of the original photograph.
