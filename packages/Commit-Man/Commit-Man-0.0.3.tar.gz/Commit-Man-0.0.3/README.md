# Commit Man

Commit-Man is a version control system that helps the user keep track of and manage different versions of their files.
It features a CLI and a GUI - the complete set of features are available in the CLI, while the GUI features a limited set of features currently (primarily repository browsing functions and viewing diffs across versions).  

A repository can have a .gitignore file that specifies for which files changes are to be ignored across versions (when creating new versions). A special folder (.cm) in each repository stores data for version management.
