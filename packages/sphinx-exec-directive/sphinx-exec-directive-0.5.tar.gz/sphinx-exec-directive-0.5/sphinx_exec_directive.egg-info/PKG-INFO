# sphinx-exec-directive

Run Python code blocks and display the output directly within Sphinx documentation.

This is based very strongly on [matplotlib's `plot_directive` extension](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/sphinxext_plot_directive_api.html?highlight=plot%20directive#module-matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive), but is used for running code instead of generating plots.

**Note:** This allows arbitrary code execution using [`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec). Don't do silly things with it.


## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```
pip install sphinx-exec-directive
```

or manually:

```
git clone https://github.com/yongrenjie/sphinx-exec-directive
cd sphinx-exec-directive
pip install .
```

Then, inside your Sphinx `conf.py`, add `sphinx_exec_directive` to your list of extensions (note: underscores not hyphens).

```
extensions = [
    sphinx_exec_directive,
    # other extensions...
]
```


## Example usage

A short example will suffice. Putting

```
.. exec::
   
   print(1 + 1)
```

into your RST file will generate two literal blocks, one with the 'input' source code, and one with the captured stdout.
It looks pretty basic, but it does the job:

Note that objects **must** be printed to stdout, or they will not be displayed.
This behaviour therefore differs slightly from the functionality in a Jupyter notebook (where the last line is evaluated and the result displayed automatically), or the interactive Python console.
If nothing is printed to stdout (or only empty space is) then the output literal block will be omitted.

## From a file

Instead of inserting the code literally into the RST sources, you can also put it in a separate file.
The file path **must** be given relative to the top-level Sphinx directory (i.e. the directory which `conf.py` is in):

```
.. exec:: subfolder/my_script.py
```

The same conditions apply; anything you want to display must be printed to stdout.

## Other processes

Currently simple Haskell code can be run: to do this, use `:process: haskell` as follows.
You will need to have `runghc` installed and available in your `PATH`.

```
.. exec::
   :process: haskell

   main :: IO ()
   main = print $ take 10 fibs
     where
       fibs = 0 : scanl (+) 1 fibs
```

I plan to generalise this (see [#7](https://github.com/yongrenjie/sphinx-exec-directive/issues/7)).

## Caching

Outputs are cached by default, **unless** context preservation has been requested in any part of the same document (see [#4](https://github.com/yongrenjie/sphinx-exec-directive/issues/4) for rationale).
To turn this off on a per-codeblock basis (e.g. if the code depends on the time which it is run at), specify a falsy value for the `:cache` option.

```
.. exec::
   :cache: false
   
   from datetime import datetime
   print(datetime.now())
```

## Preserving context between `exec` blocks

Setting the `:context:` option to a truthy value will keep any objects in the current exec directive "alive" for the next one.
Note that this only works for Python blocks, and is incompatible with caching (see above).

```
.. exec::
   :context: true

   x = 5
   print(x)

Some other text goes here... Let's print x again...

.. exec::

   print(x)

It will work.

```
