## 一、environment and dependencies
- python: 3.7.9
- os: win10(not test in linux, but this software should be cross-platform).
- see ./requrements.txt which is generated with the command: pip freeze > requirements.txt

Besides, i use Peakcan(not can-use box) to get the data from radar.
So in order to show data by CAN-BUS(inline or record), you also need to install Peakcan driver.
See link: https://www.peak-system.com/


## 二、How to install DataShow?
1. install the Peak-Can driver. See link: https://www.peak-system.com/, and dowload, install PEAK-System_Driver-Setup.zip.
2. pip install DataShow
3. go to the python scripts directory and find DataShow_gui.exe, then click and enjoy it.

Notice: the recorded data will be stored in C:\data_records\


## 三、develop in virtual environment
comply the commands below:

1. python3 -m venv env
2. set the above virtual environment as your work environment
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. create a file which its type(or suffix) should be ".pth" in ./env/Lib/site-packages.For example, the file names my.pth.
5. fill the above file with the path of this project.For example, "C:\\Projects\\data_replay" in my PC.
6. enjoy yourself.


## 四、package-commands
1. python setup.py bdist_wheel
2. twine upload dist/*

## 五、install
- pip install -i https://pypi.org/simple --upgrade DataShow
