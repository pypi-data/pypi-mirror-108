## Examples

<h3 align="center"><i><b>Select</b></i></h3>

You can use the `Select` class to create a prompt that asks the user to select a single option among a list of them, allowing the user to shuffle through them by using the arrow keys.

If you would like to to see an example of this in action, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m cues.select
```

Here's some example code showing how you could create a `Select` prompt:

```python
from cues import Select


name = 'programming_language'
message = 'Which of these is your favorite programming language?'
options = ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'C++', 'C#']

cue = Select(name, message, options)
answer = cue.send()
print(answer)
```

This produces the following output:

<h3 align="center"><i><b>Confirm</b></i></h3>

You can use the `Confirm` class to create a prompt that displays a message to the user and then asks them to enter y (Yes) or N (No).

If you would like to to see an example of this in action, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m cues.confirm

        'name': 'first_name',
        'message': 'What is your first name?',
        'default': 'Giovanni'
    },
    {

<h3 align="center"><i><b>Survey</b></i></h3>

You can use the `Survey` class to display a series of questions to the user and have them give a rating based on a scale that you provide.

```
python -m cues.survey

Here's some example code showing how you could create a `Survey` prompt:

message = 'Please rate your satisfaction with the following areas:'
scale = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        'name': 'customer_service',
        'message': 'Customer service'
    },

<h3 align="center"><i><b>Checkbox</b></i></h3>

You can use the `Checkbox` class to give a user a list of options and have them select as many as they would like by using the spacebar.

<h3 align="center"><i><b>Password</b></i></h3>

You can use the `Password` class when you need input from the user but would prefer their input be hidden while they type as it may contain sensitive information.

```
python -m cues.password
```

```python
from cues import Password

message = 'Password:'

cue = Password(name, message)
answer = cue.send()
print(answer)
