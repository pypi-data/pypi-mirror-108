def shuffle(times, offset_lim, iterations, **kwargs):
    '''
    Increment the provided time series by a random period of time in order to 
    destroy the correlation between spike times and animal behaviour.
    
    The increment behaves circularly
    
    * Initially, we have two time series, Tracking and SpikeTimes, both with 
      values in the range `[t0, t1]`. 
    * After incrementing the SpikeTimes by T, we have Tracking in `[t0, t1]`
      and SpikeTimes in `[t0+T, t1+T]`.
    * Take all spike times in the range `[t1, t1+T]` and map back to `[t0, t0+T]`
      by subtracting `(t1-t0)`
    
    The end result should be a series of times also in the range [t0, t1], 
    with the same intervals between times, but the exact value of those times
    has changed. if tracking_range not provided, then two spikes (previously 
    first, last) will noe have zero spacing
    
    The random numbers are drawn from a pseudorandom, uniform, distribution in 
    the range `[offset_lim, t1-offset_lim]`
        
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    times: np.ndarray
        1D array of times to be shuffled
    offset_lim: float
        Defines the range of values by which each iteration can be offset. Each
        iteration will have an offset in `[offset_lim, max(times)-offset_lim]`
    iterations: int
        How many copies of times should be returned (each copy incremented by a
        random offset limited by `offset_lim`)
    tracking_range: array_like, optional
        The time range over which tracking behaviour exists, defining the
        times at which spike indexes are looped back on themselves
        This can be provided either as a 2-element tuple `[t0, t1]`, or as 
        the entire list of tracking timestamps. In each case, the min and 
        max values are used as `t0`, `t1`.
        If no values are provided, then the first and last spike times
        are used. This is not desirable behaviour, since it will then guarantee 
        that in the shuffled output, two spikes will occur simultaneously
    debug: bool, optional
        Enable additional debugging output
    
    Returns
    -------
    output: np.ndarray
        iterations x N array of times. To access a single iteration, output[i,:] or output[i]
    increments : np.ndarray
        1D array of offset values used.
