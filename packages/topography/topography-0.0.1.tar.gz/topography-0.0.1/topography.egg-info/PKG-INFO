        Contains different approaches to modeling terrain and maps in python
        
        Requirements:  
        
        - `.csv` file with incomplete sampled terrain
        
        ## [Inverse Distance Weighting](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/geostatistical-analyst/how-inverse-distance-weighted-interpolation-works.htm)  
        
        A given point `P(x, y)` is determined by the values of its neighbors, inversely to the distance of each neighbor.  
        
        This ensures a `P` is more dependent on nearer points.  
        
        - Weighting function `W(x, y)`
          - Normalized by `exp(-d(x, y))`
        
        ## [Nearest (Natural) Neighbor](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-statistics/h-how-average-nearest-neighbor-distance-spatial-st.htm)  
        
        `P(x, y)` is determined only by the value of its nearest neighbor.  
        
        ## [Spline](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/3d-analyst/how-spline-works.htm)  
        
        A 2D-spline is fit to known points, where unknown points `P(x, y)` can be determined.
