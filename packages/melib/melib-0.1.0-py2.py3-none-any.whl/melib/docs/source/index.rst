`library`
    This module has a variety of small functions that can be used to execute 
    small tasks associated with the design of mechanical components such 
    as belts and chains, gears, rotating shafts, keys, bearings, welded joints, 
    welded structures, fasteners, etc.

    The module is designed to be used in teaching machine element design to 
    second-year mechanical students.  To motivate learning of procedures and 
    relevant standards, there are no pushbutton complete designs.

    Unless otherwise specified, the formula and data reference is 'Machine Elements in Mechanical Design'
    by Mott.
    
    There is a collection of Excel data files that are accessed by the library.  These 
    files arein the ``data`` folder.   This is not a comprehensive machine design library
    but sufficient for preparing assignments, examples and exam questions.


`xt`
    This module has functions that can be called upon to generate jupyter notebooks
    for documenting the mechanical design tasks.  It also has functions to create 
    pdf documents

`excel`
    This module has functions to read and write Microsoft Excel files.  It uses the \
    python package `openpyxl`.
