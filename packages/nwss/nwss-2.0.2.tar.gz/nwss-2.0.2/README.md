## Development

### Schema

Install the app locally.

```python
git clone https://github.com/datamade/nwss-data-standard.git && cd nwss-data-standard
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Make your changes, then run the tests.

```python 
pytest
```

### JSON Schema
`nwss` comes with a Python implementation of the NWSS schema, as well as a convenience script to translate it to a JSON schema:
```bash
python3 -m nwss.dump_to_jsonschema > schema.json
```

If you make any changes to the `WaterSampleSchema` class, then you'll need to re-generate the JSON schema. If you need to tweak or fix bugs in the JSON schema that is output by that script, then you'll need to make the changes within that code.

### Demo

Run a local server and auto-bundle your scripts:

```bash
npm run develop
```
