# Shape4D

## About Shape4D

Shape4D is a tiny library for computation of 3D geometry, particularly on intersection of line with polygon.


## Core Features
- Shapes: Point, Line and Polygon.
- Creating a 3D polygon by changing its shape in definition position to its desired position.
- When a 3D Polygon intercepts a 3D line, a point will be returned. 
- `__contains__`, overloaded for point in segment and polygon.
- `__hash__` and `__eq__`, overloaded for point, segment and polygon.
- `__neg__` overloaded for polygon.


## Requirements

* [Python](http://www.python.org) 3 
* Matplotlib is needed.
