        Filters records, returns the record for matching records and returns 'None'
        for non-matching records.

        The Filter Operator takes one configuration item at creation - a _Callable_
        (function) which takes the data as a dictionary as it's only parameter and
        returns `True` to retain the record, or `False` to not pass the record
        through to the next Operator.

        Example:
            fo = FilterOperator(condition=lambda r: r.get('severity') == 'high')

        Note:
            The condition does not need to be lambda, it can be any _Callable_
            including methods.
