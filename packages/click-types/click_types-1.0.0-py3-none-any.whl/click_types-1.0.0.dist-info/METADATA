[click](https://click.palletsprojects.com) is the `Command line interface creation kit` and it helps you to create command line interfaces with some few lines of code. Click comes with meaningful defauls to make starting with it as easy as possible.

A powerful feature of click is to develop custom types to convert and/or validate user input. There are several custom types in the wild but this repository is intended to collect such custom types to make it easily accessable.
