Accelerated sparse representations and compressive sensing
====================================================================


This library aims to provide XLA/JAX based Python implementations for
various algorithms related to:

* Sparse approximation
* Compressive sensing
* Dictionary learning


Included sparse recovery algorithms:

* Orthogonal matching pursuit
* Compressive sampling matching pursuit


The library also provides

* Various simple dictionaries and sensing matrices
* Sample data generation utilities
* Framework for evaluation of sparse recovery algorithms
