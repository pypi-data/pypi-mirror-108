Description: # cpalgo
        
        cpalgo is a Python Library that contains over 100 standard competitive programming algorithms for faster access.
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import cpalgo
        
        string1 = 'algorithms'
        string2 = 'rhythms'
        
        #To find the longest common subsequence between two strings
        cpalgo.longest_common_subsequence(string1, string2) 
        
        #To count the number of prime numbers in [1,N]
        cpalgo.count_primes(234)
        
        ```
