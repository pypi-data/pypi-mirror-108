Description: # MathLang
        
        MathLang is a specially designed programming language for maths.
        
        ## Features
        
        MathLang can:
        
        * Solve maths equations
        
        * Plot 2D graphs of functions
        
        * Differentiate and integrate any functions
          
        _(and many more...)_
        
        And what's the best thing about it? You can do any of this with a single line!
        
        ## Examples
        
        A simple MathLang program looks like this:
        ```
        # Define f(x)
        # x is a reserved name for variables
        f = 5*x^2 + 11*x - 16;
        
        # Calculate f(x) at x = 2 -> f(2)
        PRINT f(2);
        
        # Solve f(x) for real roots
        real_roots = SOLVE f IN REAL;
        
        # Print real roots of f(x)
        PRINT real_roots;
        
        # Differentiate f(x)
        f1 = DIFFERENTIATE f TO x;
        
        # Print the first derivative of f(x)
        PRINT f1;
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        _To be updated..._
        
        ## Limitation
        
        As of now, the backend of MathLang is a MathLang-to-Python transpiler. In other words, Grapher source code is translated
        to Python source code, which is then executed with a Python engine.
        
        Hence, the performance of MathLang largely depends on Python itself (and various other dependencies).
        The reason for this is that Python has a repertoire of libraries that make symbolic maths and plotting simpler to do.
        
        However, in the future, we aim to either (1) develop a MathLang-to-C transpiler or (2) incorporate a Python-to-C
        transpiler with the current Grapher-to-Python one.
