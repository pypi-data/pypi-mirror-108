    PowerBot - Webservice for algotrading

    # TERMS AND CONDITIONS The Powerbot system provides B2B services for trading at intraday power markets. By using the Powerbot service, each user agrees to the terms and conditions of this licence: 1. The user confirms that he/she is familiar with the exchanges trading system and all relevant rules, is professionally qualified and in possession of a trading license for the relevant exchange. 2. The user will comply with the exchanges market rules (e.g. [EPEX Spot Market Rules](https://www.epexspot.com/en/extras/download-center/documentation) or [Nord Pool Market Rules](https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/trading/Rules-and-regulations/)) and will not endanger the exchange system at any time with heavy load from trading algorithms or by other use. 3. The user is aware of OTR (order-to-trade) limits and other limits imposed by the exchange. 4. The user is solely liable for actions resulting from the use of PowerBot.   # INTRODUCTION Powerbot is a web-based software service enabling algorithmic trading on intraday power exchanges such as EPEX, Nord Pool, HUPX, BSP Southpool or TGE. The service is straightforward to integrate in an existing software environment and provides a variety of programming interfaces for development of individual trading algorithms and software tools. Besides enabling fully automated intraday trading, it can be used to create tools for human traders providing relevant information and trading opportunities or can be integrated in existing software tools. For further details see https://www.powerbot-trading.com  ## DOCUMENTATION  In addition to this API guide, please find the documentation at https://docs.powerbot-trading.com - the password will be provided by the PowerBot team. If not, please reach out to us at support@powerbot-trading.com  ## Endpoints The Powerbot service is available at the following REST endpoints:  | Instance                | Base URL for REST Endpoints                                           | |-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------| | Test (EPEX)             | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/epex/v2/api           | | Test (Nord Pool)        | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/nordpool/v2/api       | | Test (HUPX)             | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/hupx/v2/api           | | Test (BSP Southpool)    | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/southpool/v2/api      | | Test (TGE)              | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/tge/v2/api            | | Test (IBEX)             | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/ibex/v2/api           | | Test (CROPEX)           | https://staging.powerbot-trading.com/playground/cropex/v2/api         | | Staging, Production     | Provided on request                                                   |  Access to endpoints is secured via an API Key, which needs to be passed as an \"api_key\" header in each request.   Notes on API Keys:  * API keys are specific to Test, Staging or Production.  * API keys are generated by the system administrator and need to be requested.  ## How to generate API clients (libraries) The API provides automated generation of API clients (programming libraries) for a wide range of programming languages. To generate them, please open Swagger Editor from the exchange menu, click on \"Generate Client\" and choose a programming language.  ## Errors The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be in JSON format as follows:  ``` {   \"message\": \"... an error message ...\" } ```  ## Paging The API uses offset and limit parameters for paged operations. An X-Total-Count header is added to responses to indicate the total number of items in a paged response.  ## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). This allows cross-domain communication from the browser. All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.  ## API Rate Limiting The API limits the number of concurrent calls to 50 - when that limit is reached, the client will receive 503 http status codes (service unavailable) with the following text:  ``` {   \"message\": \"API rate limit exceeded\" } ``` Clients should ensure that they stay within the limit for concurrent API calls.  ## Additional code samples Additional information and code samples demonstrating the use of the API can be found at https://github.com/powerbot-trading.  # noqa: E501

Each trade at the exchange consists of a buy and sell leg (based on the buy and sell order that were involved in the trade), whereby usually only one leg belongs to you and is therefore visible. In case of a cros-trade, both legs are visible.  This method provides a wide range of filtering options (array of portfolios, trade_id, order_id, txt etc). Please note that this method uses pagination.

Please be aware that some exchange systems may report executed trades slightly delayed. If you would like to know in real time if you have made a trade or not, we recommend to rely on the execution status of orders instead of trades or to use the NetPos attribute.  The option \"active_only\" (default yes) filters for trades that are market active by the exchange system, meaning no recalled or cancelled trades are delivered.

    def get_trades_with_http_info(self, **kwargs):  # noqa: E501
        """List of the trades (deals) that you have carried out at the exchange  # noqa: E501

        Allows you to retrieve the trades (deals) you have executed at the exchange. Each trade at the exchange consists of a buy and sell leg (based on the buy and sell order that were involved in the trade), whereby usually only one leg belongs to you and is therefore visible. In case of a cros-trade, both legs are visible.  This method provides a wide range of filtering options (array of portfolios, trade_id, order_id, txt etc). Please note that this method uses pagination. To fetch trades executed in a given time window, please use from_execution_time and to_execution_time (UTC), not api_timestamp (which indicates the time the server has received the trade confirmation, which can be delayed and might be updated).  Please be aware that some exchange systems may report executed trades slightly delayed. If you would like to know in real time if you have made a trade or not, we recommend to rely on the execution status of orders instead of trades or to use the NetPos attribute.  The option \"active_only\" (default yes) filters for trades that are market active by the exchange system, meaning no recalled or cancelled trades are delivered. The filter \"txt\" allows you to filter for trades that involve an order with a custom text in the txt attribute.  # noqa: E501
        This method makes a synchronous HTTP request by default. To make an
        asynchronous HTTP request, please pass async_req=True

        :param str ord_id: Limit the trades to those which are related to a particular order_id
        :param bool active_only: Show only those trades which are active (no rejected, recalled or cancelled trades)
        :param str cl_ordr_id: Show only those trades related to orders with a specific 'client order id' (something like 'your reference' which you can submit) together with an order
        :param str txt: Show only those trades related to orders with a specific 'custom text'. Similar to the clOrdrId, you can submit a string inside the 'txt' attribute of an order which helps you to identify trades originating from a specific order at a later point in time
        :param list[str] contract_id: Show only those trades related to a specific contract
        :param datetime from_api_timestamp: from timestamp when system has received the trade; from timestamp is 'inclusive' (i.e. >=)
        :param datetime to_api_timestamp: to timestamp is 'exclusive' (i.e. <)
        :param datetime delivery_within_start: can only be used together with delivery_within_end
        :param datetime delivery_within_end: can only be used together with delivery_within_start
        :param str delivery_area: The delivery area.
        :param str user_code: the exchange's user code
        :param datetime from_execution_time: from timestamp is 'inclusive' (i.e. >=)
        :param datetime to_execution_time: to timestamp is 'exclusive' (i.e. <)
