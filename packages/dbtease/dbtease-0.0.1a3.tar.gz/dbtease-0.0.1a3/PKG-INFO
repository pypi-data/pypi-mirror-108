Description: # dbtease
        
        _dbtease is a tool for sanely testing and deploying_
        _large multi-schema dbt repositories in a modular way._
        
        _dbt_ + _ease_ = _dbtease_
        
        ## Development Status
        
        **This tool is in very early pre-alpha status,**
        **we actively recommend that you DO NOT USE IT YET**.
        
        _You have been warned_
        
        ## Ambition
        
        dbtease handles (or _will handle_):
        - atomic swaps
        - handling of full refreshes and incremental refreshes
        - CI deployment
        - manifest management
        - easy periodic refreshes on multiple schedules using a simple CLI command.
        
        Config is managed using a yaml file in the dbt project.
        
        ## CLI reference
        
        - `dbtease status`: Outputs the current commit and deployment status.
        - `dbtease deploy`: Deploy a new version of your project.
        - `dbtease refresh`: Refresh the parts of your project which need refreshing.
        - `dbtease test`: Test your changes against the currently deployed version of your project.
        
        ## Development Roadmap
        
        These elements are not currently supported but explcitly planned:
        - Stashing the logs of certain commands for later access.
        - Having more detailed and reliable error alerting when steps fail.
        - Handling dbt snapshots and exposure checking.
