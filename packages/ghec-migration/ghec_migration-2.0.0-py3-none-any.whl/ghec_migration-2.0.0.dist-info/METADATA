This tool helps you do the below tasks

## Github Migration

#### Generate Github Personal Access Token 

- Follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to generate personal access token. Copy the token.
- For github enterprise cloud, the token should be enabled with SAML SSO
- Follow the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on)

### Access Needed 

- The user who is running this tool, should be an admin on the source and target organizations. 

### Make Repos private

Before running the tool for migration make all the repos private. You have to be an admin on the organization to do so

```
  #python3 make_private.py source_org token

```

- Doesn't organize bmx jobs into folders
- It can't skip bmx jobs
