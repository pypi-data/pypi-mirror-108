It will find a GitHub release for your platform and put it into your pip executables dir.<br>
You can use <code>sponggy <b>&lt;cmd&gt;</b></code> with any usual command (<code><b>help/start/stop/upgrade/...</b></code>) and Caddyfiles.

## Non-root pip installs and PATH

In most cases you don't need root privileges, so `pip install --user` is a better choice. Make sure that
your local user's bin is in `$PATH`. For example, on Linux:

```bash
$ python3 -m site --user-base
/home/some-user/.local
$ export PATH="~/.local/bin:$PATH"
$ # ^^ put in .bashrc if not already
$ pip install --user sponggy
```
