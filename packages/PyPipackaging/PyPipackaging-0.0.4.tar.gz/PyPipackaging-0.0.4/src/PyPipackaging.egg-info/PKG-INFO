Description: # Packaging Tutorial
        
        This is a tutorial on setting up python packages for PyPi. 
        **Steps were learned from:** [Publishing (Perfect) Python Packages on PyPi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIF3LaRqgXo&t=1281s)
        
        # Notes
        
        1)	From the folder level with setup.py : **python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel**
        - Builds a wheel that is appropriate to upload to PyPi
        - The name used in the setup.py file is added. This was a point of confusion for me. **this name is what you pip install not necessarily the name of the pythjon code that will be imported**
        2)	From the folder level with setup.py : **pip install â€“e .**
        - **installs it locally**. Tests packaging and makes it useful to your system.
        - The â€˜â€“eâ€™ allows it to link to the code you are working on rather than building copies . The â€˜ .â€™ means install in the current directory. Everytime you change the setup.py file you need to run this
        - The name used in the setup.py file is added. This was a point of confusion for me
        3)	Test it:
        - from python environment in any folder **from hellototi import say_hello**
        - **â€˜hellototiâ€™** is the python module
        - The name **â€˜PyPipackagingâ€™** is from setup.py -> name=â€™hellototinameâ€™. It is the name of the python script in the src folder. Within this script is the function say_hello
        4)	Remove excessive files with gitignore.io
        5)	Pip install twine
        - Twine upload dist/*    **user name and pasword from PyPi.com**
