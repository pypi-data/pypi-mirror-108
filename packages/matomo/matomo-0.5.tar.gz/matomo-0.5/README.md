# matomo

A Python client for Matomo based on a port of 
[the PHP tracker](https://github.com/matomo-org/matomo-php-tracker) and aiming
for 100% compatibility.

The current version should be fully compatible with Matomo 4, but it has not
been extensively tested yet.

Check `/tests` folder for an example on how to use it or `/docs` to read its API
documentation.
