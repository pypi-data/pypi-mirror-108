# dsd_pip

This package contains three algorithms that solve dense subgraph problem exactly or approximately, including Goldberg's max flow based algorithm [1], charikar's greedy peeling algorithm [2], and state-of-the-art flowless (greedy++) algorithm [3].

We also leverage all algorithms to find k-clique dense subgraph, given list of k-cliques in a certain graph. Remind this can be done with algorithms like KClist [5].
We follow [4] when contructing clique based max flow graph.

To install the package, run

    pip install dsd
