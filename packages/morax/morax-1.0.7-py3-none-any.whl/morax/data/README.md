# How the code is structured ?

- `api.py` contains api call methods for each datapoint.
- `chart.py` contains the script to fetch chart data and plot it
- `view.py` contains the script to display the respective ASCII art and wallet related info.

This folder structure allows ease of programming, modularization and easy re-use.
