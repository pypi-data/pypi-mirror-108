Description: # FFenmass
        
        FFenmass is a simple python utility to manipulate in directories and recreate them recursively, inspired by h265ize.
        Currently works in **Linux** folder structures only.
        
        
        
        ### Dependencies
        [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
        [`yaspin`](https://github.com/pavdmyt/yaspin)
        [`rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)
        
        
        ## Installation
        ```bash
        pip3 install ffenmass
        ```
        ## Usage
        
        
        
        `ffenmass` is transparent above `ffmpeg`, this means all `ffmpeg` syntax can be used with ffenmass as is ,
        with the only exception being the input (`-i`) and the output being directories instead of files.
        Because `ffenmass` ignores file extensions, you will need to specifify file container using ffmpeg's `-f` argument.
        
        
        
        
        ```bash
        ffmpeg -i input.mkv -vcodec libx265 out.mkv
        
        
        ffenmass -i /path/to/media/ -vcodec libx265 -f mkv /output/directory/
        ```
        
        
        
        `ffenmass` will encode all video files detected under the input directory and output them with **the same folder structure and filenames** in the output directory.
        
        
        
        **Make sure your input/output directories have a trailing `/`**
        ```
        /path/to/directory   #Is not a valid input
        
        /path/to/directory/  #Is a valid input
        ```
