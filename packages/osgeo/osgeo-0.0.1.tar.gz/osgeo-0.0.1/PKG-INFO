osgeo package
===============
A dummy placeholder for the `gdal` package

In order to be able to run `from osgeo import gdal`, 
You were probably trying to install `gdal` by running `pip install osgeo`.
Instead, you should either `pip install gdal` or replace `osgeo` with `gdal` in your requirements.

This package was made so an attacker would not be able to take advantage of this confusion.
