"""
Getting data into the required format for use with this library.

There are 3 useful ways to represent batch data.

`dict`: as a Python dictionary

    data = {
        "batch 1": data frame with varying number of rows, but same number of columns.
        "batch 2": etc
    }

    The `keys` are unique identifiers for each batch, such as integers, or strings.

`melt`: as a single Pandas data frame

    data = pd.DataFrame(...)

        * very large number of rows, for all batches stacked vertically on top of each other
        * some number of columns, one column per tag
        * one column, usually called "batch_id", indicates what the batch number is for that row
        * another column, usually called "time", indicates what the time is within that batch
        * typically sorted, but does not have to be

`wide`: as a single Pandas data frame, as for the "melted" version, but pivoted instead, and
these `wide` dataframes *always* have a multilevel column index, to help distinguish the tags
from the time. It is a requirement of course that this representation is only for aligned data.

    data = pd.DataFrame(...)

        * each row is a unique batch number
        * the multilevel column index has
            * level 0: the column name
            * level 1: the aligned time

        This form only makes sense if the data are aligned, so that there is the same number of
        unique elements in the level-1 column index.
