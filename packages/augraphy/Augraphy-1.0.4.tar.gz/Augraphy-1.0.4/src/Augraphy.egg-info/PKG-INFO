# Augraphy

Augmentation pipeline for rendering synthetic paper printing and scanning processes.

Turn an image like this:

![Original Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfish/augraphy/dev/images/original.png)

Into an image like this:

![Augmented Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfish/augraphy/dev/images/augmented.png)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install augraphy.

```bash
pip install augraphy
```

## Usage

```python
from Augraphy import AugraphyPipeline

img = cv2.imread("test.png")
pipeline = AugraphyPipeline(paper_texture_path="./paper_textures")
crappified, original = pipeline.crappify(img, rotate=False)
```

```paper_texture_path``` defines where the images used for non-generated paper textures will be loaded from. See the ```paper_textures``` folder on Github for examples.

You can also enable debugging mode by setting the ```debug=True``` argument.

```pipeline = AugraphyPipeline(debug=True)```

This will use cv2.imshow for each image transformation or cv2_imshow if running in Google Colab.

## Roadmap

- [X] Ink effects (Bleed/Dusty/Low)
- [X] Paper textures (Generated/Images)
- [X] Scanner effects (Scanlines/Brightness Gradients)
- [ ] Improved Configuration capabilities
