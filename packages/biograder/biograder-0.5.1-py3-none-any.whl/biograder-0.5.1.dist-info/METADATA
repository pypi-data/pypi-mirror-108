# Automatic Homework Grading and Hints

The `biograder` package is a Python package that automatically grades bioinformatics homework assignments. 
The package additionally provides hints to students as they work through the assignments in Google Colab. 
These homework assignments allow students to have hands-on coding experiences with real data. The data used 
in the homework problems comes from the `cptac` package. (For more information about the `cptac` package, 
visit [https://paynelab.github.io/cptac/](https://paynelab.github.io/cptac/)).


## How to use the biograder package

The `biograder` package is intended to be accessed and used through the 
Google Colab interface. Homework assignments have been designed in Google 
Colab for the following classes:

- [BIO 165: Introduction to Bioinformatics](https://paynelab.github.io/biograder/bio165)
- [BIO 462: Computational Cancer Biology](https://paynelab.github.io/biograder/bio462)


## Developer documentation
Documentation for anyone wanting to understand the internal workings of 
the package is available on the GitHub repository in the
