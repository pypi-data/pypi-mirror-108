Description: # CorePy package
        
        CorePy is designed to perform machine learning on data collected from geological samples of core. 
        
        CorePy bundles a wide range of data analytical tools to interpret multivariate datasets common to geological core characterization
        
        The primary focus of CorePy is to classify high resolution X-ray fluoresence data into chemofacies using unsupervised and supervised clustering tools.
        
        CorePy establishes a folder structure multiple users to work on the same datasets, and also provides visualizations that are useful to validate clustering results.
