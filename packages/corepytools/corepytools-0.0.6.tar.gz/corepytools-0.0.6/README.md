# CorePytools package

CorePytools (CorePy) is a machine learning python package applied to data collected from geological samples of core. The primary focus of CorePy is to classify high resolution 
X-ray fluoresence data into chemofacies using unsupervised and supervised clustering tools. CorePy establishes a folder structure for input and output data. Visualizations are used to validate clustering results.

Corebox photographs can be cropped and used to visualized chemofacies results. Wireline log data can be upsampled and data integrated to chemofacies for upscaling  

# Installation
pip install corepytools

# Examples and data
The authors Github account has examples and datapackages that apply corepytools.
