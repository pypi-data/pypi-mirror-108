# SECFE



Python module to download SEC filings from the EDGAR Database and extract sections of filings to perform keyword searches. 



## Brief Overview

### What each module does

**SEFD** or **SEC EDGAR Filing Downloader** is a collection of functions to download filings from EDGAR from a CSV input file.<br />

**FSE** or **Filing Section Extractor** is a collection of functions to search filings for a specific section and extract the entire section to an *rtf* file. *Please note that funcionality may be limtied or broken for Mac users due to limited LXML capabilities.*<br /> 

**SKiS** or **Section Keyword Search** is a collection of functions to search filings sections for a list of keywords and output relevant paragraphs to an *rtf* file.
