        This Module is very useful and easy to use! What this module does is that makes a folder\database and in database makes folders\tables that you can store data and classify all of them ! This Module is copyrighted as you can see from above and all free to use!
        
        Here is the codes you can use to make database:
        
        """
        #import module
        from PyDatabaseModule import *
        
        #define database location
        location = r"C:\Users\Local User\Desktop\Project"
        
        #name database
        name = "Database"
        
        # create data base
        Data(name,location)
        
        #Create table or a class Folder database 
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        #Define Table Name in table name
        CreateTableData(databaseName,databaseLocation,tableName)
        
        #This creates data file
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        #Define Table Name in table name
        #Define msgData as the label of data table like -->("hi") = "<--"
        #Define msg as value of msgData "-->" = (-->"hi"<--)
        InsertDataTable(databaseName,databaseLocation,tableName,TableData)
        
        #This writes in data files
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        #Define Table Name in table name
        WriteDataTable(databaseName,databaseLocation,tableName,TableData,msgData,msg)
        
        #This reads the datafile
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        #Define Table Name that you want to read in table name 
        ReadDataTable(databaseName,databaseLocation,tableName,TableData)
        
        #This deletes table data
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        #Define Table Name that you want to read in table name
        #Define Table data name.
        DeleteTableData(databaseName,databaseLocation,tableName,TableData)
        
        #This deletes table
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        #Define Table Name that you want to read in table name
        DeleteTable(databaseName,databaseLocation,tableName)
        
        #This deletes Database
        # Define Database Name that you want to save table in databaseName
        # Define Database location that your database is or just put "location" from above
        DeleteDataBase(databaseName,databaseLocation)
