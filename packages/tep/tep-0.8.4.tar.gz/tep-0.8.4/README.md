# tep

`tep` is a testing tool to help you write pytest more easily. Try Easy Pytest!

# Design Philosophy

- Quickly create automated test projects
- Useful third party package integration
- Code is better than config

# Key Features

- Inherit all features of `requests`ï¼Œwhat `tep.client.request` adds is just a little log.
- The `fixtures` directory is automatically imported by `conftest.py`.
- Make full use of `@pytest.fixture`, preset the global environment variables `env_vars` and login api `login`. 
- A single parameter `--tep-reports` generates the allure html test report.
- Integrate common packages such as `faker`, `jmespath`, `loguru`, `pytest-xdist`, `pytest-assume`.
- Provide a `requirements.txt` that contains some extension packages for optional manual installation.
- Gives one of pytest's best practices in automated testing.
