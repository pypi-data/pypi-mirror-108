Description: 
        I have noticed that switch/case statements are coming to Python, so I thought it would be amusing to release the 101002938662893028482039th "Missing switch/case package" to this platform.
        
        ```python
        import switchem
        
        MONKEY = 1
        ELEPHANT = 2
        GIRAFFE = 3
        HORSE = 4
        SQUIRREL = 5
        
        for case in switchem(3):
            if case(MONKEY):
                print("It is a monkey")
                break
            
            if case(ELEPHANT, GIRAFFE, HORSE):
                print("It is not a monkey or a squirrel")
            
            if case(SQUIRREL):
                print("It is not a monkey for sure")
        ```
        
        This has the fall-through behaviour (fall-through will activate as soon as the correct value is checked). It is written in for-loop notation to allow for the use of the `break` keyword. This means that using the `iter` function on these objects will only yield one object.
