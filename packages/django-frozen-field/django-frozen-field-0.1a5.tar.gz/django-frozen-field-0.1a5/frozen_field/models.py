class FrozenObjectMeta:
    """
    Dataclass for frozen object metadata, extracted from model._meta.

    This dataclass lies at the heart of the freezing process. By capturing the
    structure of a model (type, fields) it controls how the fields on a model
    object are serialized, and in reverse how JSON is deserialized (by
    determining the destination field of each serialized JSON value.)

    As an example, a Decimal field on a model would be serialized (using the
    DjanoJSONSerializer) as a string: `"cost": "1.49"`. When it comes to
    deserializing this value we need to know that it is a Decimal and not a
    string, which is where this meta model comes in. It serializes the structure
    of the model:

        {
            "model": "core.Address",
            "fields": {
                "cost": "django.db.models.fields.DecimalField"
            }
        }

    When the JSON is deserialized, we can look up the type of the field, and use
    that to convert the value back to a Decimal. In essence it does this:

        >>> cost = DecimalField.to_python("1.49")
        >>> cost
        Decimal('1.49')

    Building on this, this field information is used to create a dynamic dataclass
    that represents the model at the point of freezing.

    the class in the module (as it doesn't exist). To get around this we
    need to provide the dataclass with a `__reduce__` method that pickle
    can use.

    See https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#object.__reduce__

    above:

        >
        > A tuple of arguments for the callable object. An empty tuple must be
        > given if the callable does not accept any argument.

    The return value is a 2-tuple that contains a function used to reproduce the
    object, and a 1-tuple containing the argument to be passed to the function,
    which in this case is the dict representation of the dataclass.
